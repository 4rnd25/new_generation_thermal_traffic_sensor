## Introduction 
This is the official repository for the paper: New generation thermal traffic sensor: A novel dataset and monocular 3D thermal vision framework. As reference to this code please cite the paper.

## Installation
This code was build using python 3.11. The requirements.txt file includes all necessary packages. Additionally this repo should be part of the PYTHONPATH. Moreover it is important to clone with --recurse-submodules to get also the modified yolov7 code. The yolov7 folder should also be part of the Pythonpath.


## Data
The folder Dataset_Handling contains all necessary files: <br>

	- create_dataset_yolo_format_wo_bottom_map.py transfers the images and .csv files to yolov7 format 
	- dataset_analysis.py enables to plot the class distribution and to get the mean sizes
	- create_bottom_map.py creates the bottom maps
	- create_cam_pos.py create the Camere Position files
        
## Training
- Training the models can be done with the train_thermal_3d.py file.  
- During all experiments: yolov7/cfg/training/yolov7-tiny_cls_7_IDetectMon3D.yaml  and yolov7/data/hyp.scratch.tiny_therm_3d.yaml were used with batch size 16.


## Evaluation
- Models can be evaluated using yolov7/test_thermal_3d.py
- The inference time could be mesured with yolov7/detect_thermal_3d.py and for the onnx models with Evaluation/inference_time.py

## Detection
- Detection could be made with yolov7/detect_thermal_3d.py or yolov7/conflict_detect.py

## Export
- The model could be exported to onnx-format using: yolov7/export_to_onnx.py
